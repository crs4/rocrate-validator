# Example of a valid Workflow RO-Crate

The Galaxy workflow has been copied from the LifeMonitor repository: [sort-and-change-case.ga](https://github.com/crs4/life_monitor/blob/b6206ca348701817756e133e72174826a5c3df4a/interaction_experiments/workflow_examples/galaxy/sort-and-change-case/sort-and-change-case.ga). The abstract CWL version of the workflow, `sort-and-change-case.cwl` has been generated by converting the Galaxy one with [ro-crate-py](https://github.com/ResearchObject/ro-crate-py), which, in turn, uses [galaxy2cwl](https://github.com/workflowhub-eu/galaxy2cwl).
