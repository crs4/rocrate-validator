A Python package to validate [RO-Crate](https://researchobject.github.io/ro-crate/)s.

* Supports CLI-based validation as well as programmatic validation (so it can
  easily be used by Python code).
* Implements an extensible validation framework to which new RO-Crate profiles
  can be added.  Validation is based on SHACL shapes and Python code.
* Currently, validations for the following profiles are implemented: RO-Crate
  (base profile), [Workflow
  RO-Crate](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/specification/1.1/workflows.html),
  [Process Run
  Crate](https://www.researchobject.org/workflow-run-crate/profiles/0.1/process_run_crate.html).
  More are being implemented.

**Note**: this software is still work in progress. Feel free to try it out,
report positive and negative feedback.  Do send a note (e.g., by opening an
Issue) before starting to develop patches you would like to contribute.  The
implementation of validation code for additional RO-Crate profiles would be
particularly welcome.


## Installation

You can install the package using `pip` or `poetry`. The following instructions assume you have Python 3.8 or later installed.

#### [Optional Step: Create a Virtual Environment](#optional-step-create-a-virtual-environment)

Itâ€™s recommended to create a virtual environment before installing the package to avoid dependency conflicts. You can create one using the following command:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
````

Then, activate the virtual environment:

* On **Unix** or **macOS**:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

* On **Windows** (Command Prompt):

```bash
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

* On **Windows** (PowerShell):

```powershell
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

### 1. Using `pip` (from PyPI)

You can install the package using `pip`:

```bash
pip install roc-validator
```

### 2. Using `poetry` (from source)

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kikkomep/rocrate-validator.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd rocrate-validator
```

Ensure you have Poetry installed. If not, follow the instructions [here](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation). Then, install the package using `poetry`:

```bash
poetry install
```


## Usage

After installation, use the `rocrate-validator` command to validate RO-Crates. You can run this in a virtual activated environment (if created in the [optional step](#optional-step-create-a-virtual-environment) above) or without a virtual environment if none was created.

### 1. Using the installed package

Run the validator using the following command:

```bash
rocrate-validator validate <path_to_rocrate>
```
where `<path_to_rocrate>` is the path to the RO-Crate you want to validate.

Type `rocrate-validator --help` for more information.



### 2. Using `poetry`

Run the validator using the following command:

```bash
poetry run rocrate-validator validate <path_to_rocrate>
```
where `<path_to_rocrate>` is the path to the RO-Crate you want to validate.

Type `rocrate-validator --help` for more information.



## Running the tests

To run the tests, use the following command:

```bash
poetry run pytest
```
