`rocrate-validator` (available as `roc-validator` on PyPI) is a Python package to validate [RO-Crate](https://researchobject.github.io/ro-crate/)s
against different profiles, including the base RO-Crate profile and various extensions.

## Features

-   Validates RO-Crates against the profiles they declare to conform to.
    Currently, validation for the following profiles is implemented:
    - [RO-Crate](https://w3id.org/ro/crate/1.1) *(base profile)*
    - [Workflow RO-Crate](https://w3id.org/workflowhub/workflow-ro-crate/1.0)
    - [Workflow Testing RO-Crate](https://w3id.org/ro/wftest)
    - [Workflow Run Crate](https://w3id.org/ro/wfrun/workflow)
    - [Process Run Crate](https://w3id.org/ro/wfrun/process)
    - [Provenance Run Crate](https://w3id.org/ro/wfrun/provenance)
-   Filters profile validation rules by requirement level (i.e., `REQUIRED`, `RECOMMENDED`, `OPTIONAL`).
-   Provides detailed information about the issues found during validation.
-   Supports validation of RO-Crates stored locally as directories or as ZIP archives (`.zip` files) or remotely accessible via HTTP or HTTPS (e.g., `http://example.com/ro-crate.zip`).
-   Supports [CLI-based validation](#cli-based-validation) as well as [programmatic validation](#programmatic-validation) (so it can easily be used by Python code).
-   Extensible framework: new RO-Crate profiles can be added, implementing profile requirements as SHACL shapes and/or Python code.

<b>Note:</b> <span class="disabled font-light">this software is still work in progress. Feel free to try it out,
report positive and negative feedback. We also welcome contributions, but we suggest you send us a note (e.g., by opening an Issue) before starting to develop any code. The implementation of validation code for additional RO-Crate profiles would be particularly welcome.

## Installation

You can install the package using `pip` or `poetry`. The following instructions assume you have Python 3.8 or later installed.

#### [Optional Step: Create a Virtual Environment](#optional-step-create-a-virtual-environment)

Itâ€™s recommended to create a virtual environment before installing the package to avoid dependency conflicts. You can create one using the following command:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
```

Then, activate the virtual environment:

-   On **Unix** or **macOS**:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

-   On **Windows** (Command Prompt):

```bash
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

-   On **Windows** (PowerShell):

```powershell
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

### 1. Using `pip` (from PyPI)

You can install the package using `pip`:

```bash
pip install roc-validator
```

### 2. Using `poetry` (from source)

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/crs4/rocrate-validator.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd rocrate-validator
```

Ensure you have Poetry installed. If not, follow the instructions [here](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation). Then, install the package using `poetry`:

```bash
poetry install
```

## CLI-based Validation

After installation, use the `rocrate-validator` command to validate RO-Crates. You can run this in an active virtual environment (if created in the [optional step](#optional-step-create-a-virtual-environment) above) or without a virtual environment if none was created.

### 1. Using the installed package

Run the validator using the following command:

```bash
rocrate-validator validate <path_to_rocrate>
```

where `<path_to_rocrate>` is the path to the RO-Crate you want to validate.

Type `rocrate-validator --help` for more information.

### 2. Using `poetry`

Run the validator using the following command:

```bash
poetry run rocrate-validator validate <path_to_rocrate>
```

where `<path_to_rocrate>` is the path to the RO-Crate you want to validate.

Type `rocrate-validator --help` for more information.

## Programmatic Validation

You can also integrate the package programmatically in your Python code.

Here's an example:

```python

# Import the `services` and `models` module from the rocrate_validator package
from rocrate_validator import services, models

# Create an instance of `ValidationSettings` class to configure the validation
settings = services.ValidationSettings(
    # Set the path to the RO-Crate root directory
    rocrate_uri='/path/to/ro-crate',
    # Set the identifier of the RO-Crate profile to use for validation.
    # If not set, the system will attempt to automatically determine the appropriate validation profile.
    profile_identifier='ro-crate-1.1',
    # Set the requirement level for the validation
    requirement_severity=models.Severity.REQUIRED,
)

# Call the validation service with the settings
result = services.validate(settings)

# Check if the validation was successful
if not result.has_issues():
    print("RO-Crate is valid!")
else:
    print("RO-Crate is invalid!")
    # Explore the issues
    for issue in result.get_issues():
        # Every issue object has a reference to the check that failed, the severity of the issue, and a message describing the issue.
        print(f"Detected issue of severity {issue.severity.name} with check \"{issue.check.identifier}\": {issue.message}")
```

The following is a possible output:

```bash
RO-Crate is invalid!
Detected issue of severity REQUIRED with check "ro-crate-1.1:root_entity_exists: The RO-Crate must contain a root entity.
```

## Running the tests

To run the `rocrate-validator` tests, use the following command:

```bash
poetry run pytest
```
